Marts are bugged. (FIXED: Uses "shop items by badge count")
Proton's first battle has him as "Team Rocket Proton" instead of "Rocket Admin Proton". FIXED: "RocketA" takes the place of "Rocket Admin", for some reason. Tested this with "Philip Sawyer"
Goldenrod City tower tiles are bugged after you answer the quiz questions. (Possible fix...?)
Day Care tileset is bugged.
FIXED: Gyarados on Lake of Rage OW has incorrect graphics. (Bugfix: was able to make Gyarados shiny in battle!)
Mahogany Gym is corrupted. (FIXED)
Petrel, Ariana, and Archer OW sprites use incorrect palettes. So does Clair.
Blackthorn City's door anims are bugged
